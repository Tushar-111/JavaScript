Constant Reference, Not Immutable Value:

If a const variable refers to an object or an array, the reference cannot change, but the contents of the object/array can still be modified.
javascript
Copy code
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

Feature	               let	                  const
Reassignment	      Allowed	             Not allowed
Initialization   	 Optional	        Mandatory at declaration
Scope	             Block-scoped	       Block-scoped
Mutability	         Mutable	        Immutable reference

Use const when the value of a variable should not change (e.g., configuration values, constants).
Use let for variables whose values may change over time (e.g., counters, loop variables).
